## ```okayql```

```okayql``` is a new comprehensive linting tool for working with Microsoft Sentinel & Defender Advanced Hunting KQL

## Building

To build okayql from sources you will need at least the .NET core SDK v8.0.413. Then follow the steps as described here:

```bash
dotnet build src/Kusto.Language/Kusto.Language.csproj
dotnet run --project src/Kusto.Language
```

## Naming

The name ```okayql``` is a playful nod to how it's pronounced: "Oh-Kay-Q-L". Say it out loud, and you'll hear "OK KQL". A fitting name for a tool that helps ensure your KQL is clean, correct, and ready to go
