## ```okayql```

```okayql``` is a new comprehensive linting tool for working with Microsoft Sentinel & Defender Advanced Hunting KQL

## Building

To build okayql from sources you will need at least the .NET core SDK v8.0.413. Then follow the steps as described here:

```bash
dotnet build src/Kusto.Language/Kusto.Language.csproj
dotnet run --project src/Kusto.Language
```

Kusto Query Language is a simple yet powerful language to query structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. It assumes a relational data model of tables and columns with a minimal set of data types. The language is very expressive, easy to read and understand the query intent, and optimized for authoring experiences. The Kusto Query Language is optimal for querying telemetry, metrics, and logs with deep support for text search and parsing, time-series operators and functions, analytics and aggregation, geospatial, vector similarity searches, and many other language constructs that provide the optimal language for data analysis.

For documentation, see [Kusto Query Language (KQL) overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/kusto/query/?view=azure-data-explorer).

## Content

This repo contains a C# parser and a semantic analyzer as well as a translator project that generates the same libraries in Java Script. See [usage examples](src/Kusto.Language/readme.md)

## API Package

This source code is also available as a [package on nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language/)

## Query Editor

If you need to provide a query authoring experience for the language, consider using the [Kusto language plugin for the Monaco Editor](https://github.com/Azure/monaco-kusto)
